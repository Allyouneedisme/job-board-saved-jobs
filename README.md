# Job board starter

A small job board for an insiderOne work sample. It is made up: the jobs and
companies are not real.

## Run it

You need Node 20 or newer. There are no packages to install.

```
npm start      # then open http://localhost:3000
npm test       # runs the tests in test/
```

## What is here

- `server.js`: the web server. `GET /api/jobs?q=` lists jobs, `GET /` serves the page.
- `lib/jobs.js`: reading and searching the jobs. Pure functions.
- `jobs.json`: the jobs.
- `public/`: the page and its script.
- `test/`: tests, using Node's built-in test runner.

## Your task

See the work sample brief on insiderOne: add saved jobs (save, list, remove),
with tests, and add a short section to this README about what you built.
